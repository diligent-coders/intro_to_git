# Intro to Git

Welcome to the Diligence Media/Gaming community "Intro to Git" learning repo! This short course will give you a quick intro to Git.

## Coursework

*What is Git?* - The first part of this course is simple. We won't need to know every single last detail about Git, but we'll want a brief understanding of what it is to get started. First, watch this brief [2 Minute Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ReR1YJrNOM) explaining what Git is.

## Homework

1) *Make a Github Account* - Go to [Github](https://www.github.com) and make an account. Github will be the place where we will save all of our code and serve as a public record of our learning. After you've created an account, post your username in the #learn_programming channel on Discord.

2) *Install Git on Your Machine* - After that, install Git itself. Click [this link](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) for the official instructions for installing Github. be sure to follow the instructions for your machine. Ping the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/rRGukhvEYE) if you have any issues.

3) *Install Code Editor* - After that, install a code editor app. Some good ones are [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) but its up to you.

5) *What's next?* - Congratulations, after youve've got Git setup, you're one step forward in your coding journey and you'll be able to more effectively collaborate with one another and save our work.

## FAQ
1. _Who teaches this course?_ <br>
Diligence programming mentors! At the moment, that'll primarily be [ZASman](https://github.com/ZASMan) with some assistance from Diligence team members with programming experience. We're basically just a group of friends trying to have fun and help each other learn some new skills.<br>

2. _I have a learning disability, how can I succeed in this course?_<br>
Course mentors aren't trained educators but will collaborate with one another and try to help you to the best of their ability.<br>

3. _I feel like a failure with technical things and I've had some bad experiences in the past, is this right for me?_
Arnold Schwarzanagger once said, _"Don't be afraid to fail. ... You can't always win, but don't be afraid of making decisions."_ You made the decision to come here to try and learn, so why not just give it a chance? The best thing that could happen is that this sets you on a path to learning programming and a new job.

4. _I'm not a great classroom learner, how do I know I'll be able to handle this course?_<br>
While we'll meet and correspond and regularly as you can, the beauty of an open source and online course like this is that you can follow along and submit assignments at your own pace, and the course mentors will get back to you.
