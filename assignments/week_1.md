Welcome to learn programming! Here's our first week of homework:

1) Make a Github Account - Go to www.github.com and make an account.

Github will be the place where we will save all of our code and serve as a public record of our learning.
Then, post your username here.

2) Install Git - After that, install Git itself! Here's the instructions:

3) Install code Editor - After that, install a code editor app. Some good ones are Atom, and Sublime, but its up to you.

3) Cloning a repo - After that, clone this repository https://github.com/ZASMan/diligent_coders . Ask in the channel, or look up how to do it!

4)  Our First Pull Request - If you have cloned the repository successfully, open up your terminal, and then do cd diligent_coders . Next, type i git status.  You should see, on branch master.

Now you'll create a new branch. Type in git checkout -b test_branch_for_xxx with xxx being your username or something unique to create that branch name.

Now, open up that text editor and put the folder for diligent_coders in it. Open up the readme.md file, and write a message saying, "Hi, I'm (Your Github Username), and I'm here to learn how to code because _." For extra points, embed your username in a link to your Github profile (lookup markdown).

After you've saved that readme.md file, type i git add readme.md into your terminal to add your changes to that file to be committed to Github. Now, type i git commit -m "Write a descriptive message here about your changes.", and then git push origin whatever_your_branch_is_called. if you forget your branch name, type in git status.

After that, go to https://github.com/ZASMan/diligent_coders, click "pull requests", and open up a pull request with that branch name.
