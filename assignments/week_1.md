## Welcome to the Diligence Media coding community! Here's our first week of homework:

1) *What is Git?* - First, let's check out this brief [2 Minute Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ReR1YJrNOM) explaining what Git is.

2) *Make a Github Account* - Go to [Github](https://www.github.com) and make an account. Github will be the place where we will save all of our code and serve as a public record of our learning. After you've created an account, post your username in the #learn_programming channel on Discord.

3) *Install Git on Your Machine* - After that, install Git itself. Click [this link](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) for the official instructions for installing Github. be sure to follow the instructions for your machine. Ping the Discord channel if you have any issues.

4) *Install Code Editor* - After that, install a code editor app. Some good ones are [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) but its up to you.

5) *What's next?* - After we've got Git setup, we'll be able to more effectively collaborate with one another and save our work.
